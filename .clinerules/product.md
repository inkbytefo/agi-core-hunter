# AGI Core Hunter - Product Overview

## Project Purpose
AGI Core Hunter is a systematic research project aimed at discovering fundamental principles underlying Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Rather than pursuing larger models, the project focuses on understanding the core "physics" of intelligence through falsification-driven experiments.

## Research Methodology
- **Hypothesis-driven approach**: Each theoretical principle is reduced to testable, single-sentence claims
- **Minimal living laboratories**: Simple toy environments (grid worlds, 2D physics) that isolate specific principles
- **Rapid falsification cycles**: Quick test-and-eliminate loops rather than years of theoretical debate
- **Principle-specific metrics**: Success measured by OOD robustness, sample efficiency, causal adaptation, not just SOTA scores

## Core Research Areas
The project systematically investigates these theoretical frameworks:
- **Algorithmic Probability & Universal Agents** (MDL/Kolmogorov Complexity)
- **Causality & Representation** (Pearl, Sch√∂lkopf approaches)
- **Free Energy Principle & Active Inference** (Friston's framework)
- **World Models & Self-supervised Learning** (Schmidhuber, LeCun approaches)
- **Computational Thermodynamics** (Physical limits of intelligence)
- **Self-improving Systems** (Evidence-based code modification)

## Expected Outputs
1. Experimental result reports documenting successes and illuminating failures
2. Open-source "AGI Principle Comparison Benchmark" (APCB)
3. Reproducible codebase with all agents, environments, and analysis tools
4. "Principle Cards" library - one-page summaries of each tested principle

## Language & Documentation
- Primary documentation is in Turkish (Turkish research team)
- Code comments and technical implementation in English
- Research papers and principle cards bilingual when possible
